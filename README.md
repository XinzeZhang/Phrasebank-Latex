# Phrasebank-Latex

 This is a repository of recording phrasal elements in academic english with latex.

As shown in main.pdf, this demo is with only one column and line number on the both sides,  modified by xinze zhang from ACL2023.sty. The official ACL style sources can be found at https://github.com/acl-org/ACLPUB/.

The arrangement of the title and sections in this demo is derived from the work: Morley, John. "Academic phrasebank." *Manchester: University of Manchester* (2014).
